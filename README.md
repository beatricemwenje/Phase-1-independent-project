# Phase-1-independent-project

# PREREQUISITES.
The reader should have a basic knowledge of:
1:Html.
2:Css.
3:Javascript.
4:Have a text editor of his/her choice .Though I recommend vs code.
5:Internet connectivity.

# PROJECT OBJECTIVES.
1:Know how to use javascript Date Class.
2:Know how to create a function.
3:Know how to invoke or call a function.
4:Know what a variable scope is.
5:Understand how ternary operator works.

# IMPLEMENTATION.
To impement the clock,first we need to create a folder for our html.css and javascript.

# STEPS.
1:Create your html file,call it ndex.html.

Run this command to open your index.html file in vs code:

touch index.html.

2:Create your javascript file and declare a function in it.I call mine displayTime.In this function,declare a variable and asign the javascript object to it.
All we need to build our digital clock will be in the function block apart from the setInterval method.

setInterval, is a method in JavaScript that takes two parameters, a function and the time it will take before the function executes.

Here is the syntax on how to represent setInterval:

setInterval(displayTime, 1000);

The code above means that the function displayTime will keep executing after every 1000 milliseconds.
3:We need to create a css file an add this styles.I call mine index.css.

# CONCLUSION
With all this we have been able  to build our digital clock using only html,css and javascript.
